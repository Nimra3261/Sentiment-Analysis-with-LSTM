# Sentiment Analysis with LSTM

## Overview

This project implements a sentiment analysis model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to classify sentiments in tweets. The model is trained on a dataset containing tweets labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Features

- Preprocessing of text data including tokenization and padding.
- LSTM model for sentiment classification.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
- Ability to make predictions on new data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of three columns:

- **id**: Integer identifier for each tweet.
- **label**: Integer sentiment label (e.g., 0 for negative, 1 for positive, 2 for neutral).
- **tweet**: The tweet text.



## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-lstm.git
cd sentiment-analysis-lstm
```

## Usage

1. Load the dataset and preprocess it to handle missing values and invalid labels.
2. Tokenize and pad the tweet text.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Build and compile the LSTM model.
5. Train the model and evaluate its performance.
6. Use the model to make predictions on new tweet data.

### Example

To run the project, execute the following in your terminal:

```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

## Results

After training, the model's accuracy and other evaluation metrics will be displayed. You can also test the model with new tweets to see the sentiment predictions.
